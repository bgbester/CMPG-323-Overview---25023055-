# CMPG-323-Overview-25023055-
This is the overview of my journey in CMPG 323 for my 5 projects. This repo will help you to understand how I think everything should be thought of and how I will be completing the project.

# Overview of strategy 
If you look at the different ways to look at the project, I have decided to split the repositories completely but will have one main project to manage all the repositories. (I do not know yet if we will fork the repositories from the original repository or if we will create one from scratch. This we will decide later in the project.)

# Project and repository context and how they are integrated with diagram
We will explain with a diagram a bit down, but we will have 1 main project with the 5 repositories linked to it separately, so we can work on different repositories at the same time. It makes the planning and execution a lot easier.

A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, adding custom fields to track metadata specific to your team, and visualize work with configurable charts. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your teamâ€™s needs and processes.

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in the plain text Markdown language. You can use this cheat sheet to get started with Markdown syntax. GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now. See full post: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

# Branching Strategy with diagram
When we look at we can look at all 5 projects, we will have one main project with all the Mile Stones and tasks that will be linked to 4 different repositories and the 5 repositories will be split entirely from each other, we will fork a repository of the similarities are the same and we can save time. Please see the image below.

# Gitignore
We will use 1 single file per repository to save all the password information but will upload a dummy file so that anyone can change the password and username then everything will start working. The file will be called Autentication_Share, we will save all our details in the real Authentication file, but will not share it on Github, thus all the user has to do is rename the Authentication_Share file to the original name and everything should start working.

# Storage of credentials and sensitive information
We will store our authentication details in a text file, for now, we may move it to a database with all the details.

# Referencing used information
All the info I get from any 3rd parties will be referenced in the text and the links can be found in my referencing document found at CMPG-323-Overview-25023055/Referencing Document
