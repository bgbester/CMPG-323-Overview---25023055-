# CMPG-323-Overview---25023055-
This is my overview of my journey in CMPG 323 for my 5 projects. This repo will help you to understand how I think everything should be though of and how I will be completing the project.

#Overview of strategy 
If you look at the different ways to look at the project, I have decided to split the repositories compltely but will have one main project to manage all the repositories. (I do not know yet if we will fork the repositories from the original repository or if we will create one from scratch. This we will decide later in the project.)
